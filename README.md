# Computer-Vision-Tutorial

Implementation of various computer vision algorithms and mini-projects that will help in building the foundation of computer vision.  
As Computer Vision is one of the hottest topics in artificial intelligence. It is making tremendous advances in self-driving cars, robotics as well as in various photo correction apps. Steady progress in object detection is being made every day. GANs is also a thing researchers are putting their eyes on these days.  
In order to take your first step towards computer vision, you can implement/view the following mini projects to get the fundamentals clear.

## List of Implemented Mini-Projects
* Road Lane Detector
* Face, Night, Landscape classifier
* Face Recognition
* Object Detection
* CIFAR10 classification using Bag of visual words (BoVW)
* CIFAR10 classification using Vector of locally aggregated descriptor (VLAD)
* CIFAR10 classification using CNN achitecture
